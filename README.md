# CSC190
CSC190 projects and labs

Just all of my projects and labs from this course. Some of the files and/or lines of code are directly from the assignment
materials, so I would assume my prof wrote them. Otherwise, they should be my own :). Some of these took me some time, but
they should all run and not have memory leaks hehe.

There's some cool stuff in here (stuff that took me hours but I still did it cuz they were cool). 
There's python and C code somewhere that converts binary tree to general tree me thinks.
There's a python library that is a basic chess game and has a computer player that looks 3 steps ahead. 
Although I tried making the computers play against each other, and trust me that was very boring to watch. 
It does beat a random player very easily tho.

PS: if you are a first year engsci, please don't steal my code. It will probably get both of us in trouble.
